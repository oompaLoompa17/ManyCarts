            </tr>
            <tr>
                <!-- why do you need both name and data-th-field? -->
                <!-- name is Required for Form Submission: Without the name attribute, the value of the 
                  input field will not be included in the HTTP request when the form is submitted. 
                  This would prevent Spring from binding the uid value to your controller method parameter.

                data-th-field is Used by Thymeleaf for Model Binding: When rendering the form, 
                the data-th-field attribute ensures that the input field is populated with the current 
                value of the uid property from the model. If you're using Thymeleaf to generate the form 
                dynamically, this binding is necessary to display the correct data in the input field. -->
